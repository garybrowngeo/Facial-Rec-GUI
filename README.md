# Facial-Rec-GUI
Facial Rec GUI for CompreFace

This code is designed to work with CompreFace Facial Recognition running on docker. 

It creates a simple GUI to allow you to search a directory (and its subdirectories) full of your jpg files for a particular subjects face as well as adding new subjects and faces

You will need to follow Compreface's instructions to set-up your instance (https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace) and get your api-key
from your instance.

Run set_env.py to setup your environment variables i.e. Domain (Default: http://localhost), Port (Default: 8000) and API Key. These must match the Compreface instance you are running.
